# Clean Code Dojo
Clean Code Dojo repository contains several Kata implementations.
In my blog agile-coding.blogspot.com you will find explanation about Kata.
Here you find the Bowling Game Kata developed TDD style.
Have a look at the Commits to see how it was done step by step in Wasa style as if the Kata was done by more than one person.
